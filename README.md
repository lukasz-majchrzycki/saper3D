# Saper 3D

A simple game based at well known Saper. But it's more complicated...

The game board consists of few layers, each Saper's field counts mines from a certain layer as well as from the upper and lower ones. Use right-click to mark mines, change layers by scroll bar, use Ctrl to locate your field on adjacent layers.

Use your head and **enjoy!**
